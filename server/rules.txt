AI Code Review General Ruleset

1. Code Structure 
- Follow language-specific styles guides.
- Avoid overly deeply nested loops or functions. Helper functions can be utilised for refactors.
- Ensure consistent naming (snake_case for functions, CamelCase for classes or language-dependent).
- Functions should serve a single purpose & do one thing.

2. Readibility & Naming rules
- Variables should be named descriptive(explanatory) & unambiguous in nature.
- Avoid magic numbers & instead be named with constants.
- Proper Identation is important & usage of whitespace to associate related things.
- Group related logic & modules logically.

3. Comments Rules
- Don't add obvious noise. Avoid comment out code, just remove.
- Public functions/class preferably can include a docstring describing it self. 

4. Tests & Security 
- Sanitize & validate all inputs; No raw sql queries without parameterization.
- Codebase must not contain any potential hardcoded API keys, secrets & tokens.
- Tests (like unit tests, etc) must run determinstically & should independent & repeatable.
